Project Overview: RFID Inventory Management System

website link:https://rfid-inventory-system.netlify.app/

Objective

The RFID Inventory Management System is a lightweight, browser-based application designed to demonstrate the capabilities of RFID technology for efficient inventory tracking and management. The project enables users to scan RFID tags, manage inventory data, filter records, and export data for further analysis.

Key Features

1. RFID Tag Scanning

Users can input RFID tag data manually.

Associate each scanned tag with a specific item name.

Automatically records a timestamp for when the tag was scanned.



2. Inventory Management

Displays all scanned RFID tags and their associated details in a tabular format.

Real-time updates to the inventory table as new tags are scanned.



3. Filtering

Users can filter inventory records by item name using a search box.

Dynamic filtering ensures ease of access to specific records.



4. Sorting

Allows sorting of inventory records by RFID Tag, Item Name, or Timestamp by clicking on table headers.



5. Export to CSV

Provides functionality to export the inventory data to a CSV file for offline storage or analysis.

Project Workflow

1. Input RFID Tags:

Enter RFID tag values and item names into the scanner interface.



2. Data Management:

View and manage all entries in an interactive table.



3. Filter & Sort:

Use the filter box to search for specific items.

Sort table columns to organize data based on needs.



4. Data Export:

Save the inventory data as a CSV file for sharing or record-keeping.

How It Works

1. RFID Input Handling:
The system accepts RFID tag details and associates them with metadata such as item name and timestamp.


2. Dynamic Table Management:
The inventory table dynamically updates as new tags are added.


3. JavaScript-Driven Functionalities:
Features like filtering, sorting, and exporting are implemented using lightweight JavaScript code.
